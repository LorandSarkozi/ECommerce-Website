# ECommerce-Website

The Online ECommerce Website is a comprehensive web application designed to facilitate the buying and selling of products over the internet. This project integrates a robust backend system built with Java Spring, a dynamic and responsive frontend using Angular, and a MySQL database for managing all data operations. The goal is to create a seamless shopping experience for users while providing administrators with the tools needed to manage the inventory, process orders, and monitor sales.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Java Spring Framework
- **Frontend:** Angular
- **Database:** MySQL

## Backend (Java Spring)
The backend of the ECommerce Website is developed using the Java Spring Framework. Key components and features include:
- **Spring Boot:** For setting up the application with embedded servers and simplified configuration.
- **Spring MVC:** To handle HTTP requests and responses, ensuring RESTful API endpoints.
- **Spring Data JPA:** To interact with the MySQL database, managing data access layers, and performing CRUD operations.
- **Spring Security:** For securing the application, including user authentication and authorization.
- **Spring Boot Test:** For testing the application components to ensure reliability and performance.

## Frontend (Angular)
The frontend is developed using Angular to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. Key components and features include:
- **Angular CLI:** For project scaffolding, development, and building processes.
- **Angular Components:** To build modular, reusable UI components.
- **Angular Services:** To handle business logic and interact with the backend APIs.
- **Routing:** To manage navigation between different views and components.
- **Reactive Forms:** For handling user input and validation.
- **HttpClient:** To communicate with the backend RESTful services.

## Database (MySQL)
MySQL serves as the relational database management system for the project. Key aspects include:
- **Schema Design:** A well-structured database schema to support various entities such as users, products, orders, and categories.
- **Data Persistence:** Using Spring Data JPA to manage entity relationships and perform database operations.
- **SQL Queries:** For complex data retrieval and manipulation when necessary.
